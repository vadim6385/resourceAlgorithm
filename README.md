# resourceAlgorithm
Final Project - resource distribution algorithm

Formalization:

1) Define the set of users or devices that will be accessing the network, denoted as U = {u1, u2, ..., un}.

2) Define the total available bandwidth B.

3) For each user u in U, define a function f(u) that represents the demand for bandwidth by that user. This function should take into account factors such as the user's current level of activity and the type of applications or services they are using.

4) Define an allocation function A(u) that maps each user to a portion of the total available bandwidth. This function should be designed to satisfy the demand for bandwidth by each user while also maximizing the overall efficiency of the network.

5) For each user u in U, compute the allocation of bandwidth A(u) using the allocation function.

6) Monitor the usage of the network and adjust the allocation of bandwidth as needed to ensure that all users receive a satisfactory level of service.
